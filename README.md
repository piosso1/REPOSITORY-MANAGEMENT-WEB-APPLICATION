The objective of this document is to designing and executing a test strategy for a hypothetical “Repository Management” web application. This application includes key functionalities such as repository creation, issue tracking, pull request handling, and user management.
This is to ensure that the Repository Management Web Application functions as expected across all critical workflows. The testing process aims to identify defects, validate system behavior, and ensure seamless integration with external services. The goal is to deliver a stable, secure, and user-friendly platform that meets business and technical requirements. The testing scope covers all key functionalities, including repository management by verifying repository creation, editing, deletion, visibility settings, and ensuring proper functionality of forking and cloning. Issue tracking will be tested by validating the creation, updating, assignment, closure of issues, adding comments, attachments, labels, and ensuring correct filtering and searching capabilities. Pull request workflows will be tested by validating creation, merging, rejection, conflict resolution, and the review and approval process. User management and permissions testing will cover user registration, authentication, role-based access control, and the invitation or removal of users. Notifications and logging will be tested by validating email and in-app notifications for different actions and ensuring accurate logging of repository events. Integration with CI/CD pipelines will be verified by testing webhooks, API interactions, and auto-build triggers on pull requests. Exclusions include testing of third-party integrations beyond API interactions, performance testing beyond agreed load limits, and detailed database-level testing unless required for functional validation. This structured testing approach ensures comprehensive coverage of major functionalities while maintaining focus on critical business processes and system reliability. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1z8FW8sgPUd4o_oM-c8289HpRnIjIXPBI
